# Frontend API handoff — Stories 1.1 and 1.2

Base URL: `<backend-origin>/api/v1`. Swagger: `<backend-origin>/api/v1/docs/`.
Import the attached `openapi.yaml` or download `/api/v1/openapi.json` from the running API.
The specification uses `/api/v1` on the documentation host. When importing a local file,
set your client's backend origin explicitly. JSON request bodies require `Content-Type: application/json`.

| Method | Path | Request | Success |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| GET | `/health` | None | 200, `{ data: { status: "ok", uptimeSeconds: number } }` |
| POST | `/auth/register` | `{ name, email, password }` | 201, `{ data: { user }, message }` |
| POST | `/auth/verify-email` | `{ token }` | 200, `{ data: { verified: true }, message }` |
| POST | `/auth/resend-verification` | `{ email }` | 202, `{ data: {}, message }` |

Registration creates students only. Do not send `roles`, `status`, or other extra fields.
Names are trimmed (2–100 characters); emails are normalized to lowercase.
Passwords need at least 8 characters and must fit within 72 UTF-8 bytes (including non-ASCII characters).

After registration, show a check-your-email screen. The configured frontend verification page
receives `?token=...`; send that value in the JSON body of `/auth/verify-email`.
Do not log or store the token permanently. Clear it from the address bar after reading it.
Email delivery must be configured on the backend. Tokens are never returned by registration or resend.

All errors have `{ error: { code, message, details: [] } }`:

| Status / code | Frontend action |
| --- | --- |
| 400 `VALIDATION_ERROR` | Display field errors from `details` |
| 400 `INVALID_OR_EXPIRED_VERIFICATION_TOKEN` | Offer a new verification email |
| 409 `RESOURCE_ALREADY_EXISTS` | Account cannot be registered again; offer resend |
| 429 rate-limit error | Respect the `Retry-After` header before allowing another attempt |
| 503 `EMAIL_DELIVERY_UNAVAILABLE` on registration | Account was created; offer resend instead of registration retry |
| 500 `INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR` | Show a generic retry message |

Resend 202 means queued, not delivered, and is identical for unknown, verified, suspended,
and unverified accounts. The worker retries transient failures; do not reveal account existence in the UI.
Health indicates the API process is alive, not that SMTP delivery is working.

Login, access tokens, refresh cookies, and password reset belong to later stories.
No Authorization header is needed for the four current endpoints.
